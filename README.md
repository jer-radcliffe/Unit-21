Create a Github repo, and a `README.md` file explaining the process for purchasing PupperCoin (or whatever name you came up with).

Also, please provide screenshots to illustrate the functionality (e.g. how you send Ether to the contract, how you add the token to MyCrypto and test a transaction, and how you test the time functionality etc.). Alternatively, you can also record your interactions with the contract as a gif (e.g. https://www.screentogif.com/)


Ensure that anyone can run the steps and add the token to MyCrypto, or a similar wallet.

Include information such as the token parameters, token name, crowdsale cap, etc.
